In the last 12 months, I had 6 papers published [#]_ (two as first author, four
as middle author). I currently have another 3 in review plus some close to
submission.

Awesome productivity, right? It wouldn't be bad for a small lab to get a paper
every two months and I'm just a person.

Unfortunately, these high numbers reflect not just the fact that I'm super
productive and work long hours [#]_, but also the fact that for the previous
two years I didn't have anything come out.

During those days, all of my work got stuck in different stages of the pipeline
without seeing the light of print. I did move between countries (twice), I did
have other things happen (like writing a thesis and what not), but no papers
published.

I did submit manuscripts. They got rejected after (sometimes long) reviews.

This post will surely get some google hits from people who think it's about not
having sex. It is not. But if it were, it wouldn't be that much different.

When you keep submitting manuscripts and they keep getting rejected, you start
to lose confidence, you lose your edge. This applies not only to the submission
process per se (refraining or delaying from submitting) but to the everyday
practice of science, you start to lose the scientific killer instict.
