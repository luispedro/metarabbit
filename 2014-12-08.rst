The last few months have been incredibly busy (hopefully, results should start
appearing in print over the next few months). I'll start writing again now.

A few links on recent(ish) anti-science victories in Europe:

1. Philae went all the way to a comet, then quickly died `because Europeans are
   afraid of "radiation"

   The Americans would still be getting data from that probe as it would be
   nuclear powered.

2. Another victory from *a coalition of environmental groups, including
   Greenpeace*: The `European Commission scrapped the position of scientific
   advisor

   The environmentalists called the position of science advisor `corporate
   lobbying
