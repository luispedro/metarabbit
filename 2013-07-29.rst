Because `my book
<http://www.amazon.com/Building-Machine-Learning-Systems-Python/dp/1782161406>`__
`just came out
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/building-machine-learning-systems-with-python-willi-richert-luis-pedro-coelho/>`__,
I am again excerpting from `a Portuguese interview with me
<http://colisor.blogspot.pt/2013/07/livros-emigracao-ciencia-politica-e.html>`__
I `mentioned previously

    *Who is the target audience for this book?*

    **Luis Pedro**: There are two distinct audiences: The first are programmers
    who do not know much of machine learning, but liked to use a classifier,
    for example. The second are people who do not need an introduction to
    machine learning (because they already know), but maybe do not know how to
    do it with the tools in Python.

    *What were the main difficulties encountered in this process?*

    **Luis Pedro**: The challenge is always to find examples that are not too
    easy, but they are not also too difficult for an introduction. In one
    case (image classification), I took some photographs to create a dataset.
    In the literature, there are classical examples which are trivial to handle
    with modern techniques and current research problems that are very
    difficult. My dataset consists of poorly framed photographs taken with a
    mobile phone camera.  Therefore, it also has a style more akin to a problem
    area or mobile web.  The aim is to distinguish photographs of buildings,
    natural landscape, or texts.

    There was nothing too complex for anyone who knows the area. In fact, when
    it comes to writing about something you already know how to do (as was the
    case), `the hard part is the motivation

    One thing we stress throughout is principled evaluation and we warn against
    overselling your results. Even in the world of research papers still find
    that mix training set and test set! Obviously not coming into work groups
    of machine learning, but in more applied areas is still those who test
    hyper-parameters in the test set.
