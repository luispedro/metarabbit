What is a Gene?

I think the `GenBank file spec
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html>`__ gets the definition
just right:

    gene: A region of biological interest identified as a gene and for which a
    name has been assigned.

That's basically it. If people call it a gene, it's a gene.

They could be meaning:

- a region in the genome that gets transcripted (or translated; but are introns part of it?)
- the nucleotide or amino-acid code in those regions
- the "reference" nucleotide code that is expected in that region
- the homologs of that (or othologs or paralogs or purposefullly remaining fuzzy because it's hard to say what's what)
- the regions of genome that cluster together across different organisms
- a higher level concept that groups several proteins together through inferred orthology
- (or perhaps even convergent evolution)
- ...

In many discussions, gene is a good word to `rationalist taboo
<http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_taboo>`__. It clears up many
mistakes when people are obliged to say what they mean by this tricky word.

Another good word to taboo is *species* when the organisms are bacteria

To even use the same word as we have for animals is probably a mistake. We need
a word for "bacteria whose rRNA clusters together in nucleotide space" without
all of the baggage of *species*.

And so we would replace a veneral biological concept with a computational
definition: progress!
