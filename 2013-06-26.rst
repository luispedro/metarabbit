    A certain minority needs to learn to write, but it is silly to think that
    this will be of interest to the majority of the population. Do you expect
    them to write for a living? How many writers can society employ? What would
    their job prospects be? And, in any case, it is far from proven that the
    illiterate classes even want to learn to write.
    The current *teach everyone
    to write* movement is a fad.

I am pretty sure I could find some 19th century conservative writing something
like the above.

Consider this version:

    A certain minority needs to learn to write **code**, but it is silly to
    think that this will be of interest to the majority of the population. Do
    you expect them to write **software** for a living? How many **coders**
    can society employ? What would their job prospects be? And, in any case, it
    is far from proven that the illiterate classes even want to learn to write.
    The current *teach everyone to **code** * movement is a fad.

We do not teach people to read & write so they can be writers!

We should not teach people to read & write code so they can be coders!

Imagine living in the modern world without being able to read. Sure, you could
get by (people do, even in the richest countries), but you would never really
understand what's going on. You are a foreigner.

ยง

Computer code is all around us, computer networks envelop us.

If you live your life without knowing how computers work, you are missing out,
you are excluded from the conversation, you deal with a world in which you are
a foreigner.

Learning how to code is not vocational, it's liberal arts: part of the general
education which is necessary to deal with the world.
