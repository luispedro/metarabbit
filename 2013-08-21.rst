This is another story of continuous improvement, this time in mahotas' little
brother imread.

Last week, `Volker Hilsenstein
<http://www.embl.de/almf/almf_services/contact/hilsenstein/>`__ here at EMBL
had a few problems with imread on Windows. This is one of those very hard
issues: how to help someone on a different platform, especially one which you
know nothing about.

In the end, the problem was an old version of libtiff. In that version, there
is a logic error (literally, there is a condition which is miswritten and
always false) and the code will attempt to read a TIFF header from a file even
when writing. Mahotas-imread was not ready for this.

Many (especially in the open-source world, unfortunately) would just say:
*well, I won't support broken versions of libtiff*: if your code does not
adhere to the spec, I am just going to not work for you.

In my case, I prefer to work around the bug and when libtiff tries to read in
write mode, return no data; which it correctly handles.

In the meanwhile, we also fixed compilation in Cygwin as well as a code path
which led to a hard crash.
