1. `On Schekman's pledge to not publish high-profile
<http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2013/12/11/down_with_the_luxury_journals.php>`__.
I almost called this *a balanced view*, but then realized that I probably used
that phrase to refer to Derek Lowe's work at least twice in the past. The man
is smart and balanced, what can I say?

2. `An interesting meeting report
<http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/12/315/abstract>`__ (closed access, sorry).
Two highlights:

    While discussing mutations that predispose to cancer, Nazneen Rahman
    (Institute of Cancer Research, UK) rightly reminded us that people make big
    decisions and have parts of their anatomy removed based on their genotype.

    [...]

    Jeanne Lawrence (University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA)
    convincingly showed that her lab was able to silence one entire copy of
    chromosome 21 in stem cells in vitro. Trisomy 21 or Downâ€™s syndrome is
    caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. [...] Lawrence and colleagues
    inserted XIST (human X-inactivation gene) into chromosome 21 in stem cells
    with trisomy 21. They then showed using eight different methods that a
    single copy of the chromosome had indeed been silenced.
    

3. A `good explanation of Bitcoin, the protocol <http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/>`__

4. Interesting article about `wine & technology
<http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21590767-high-tech-winemaking-technology-has-already-made-poor-plonk-thing-past?utm_content=buffer2fcce&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer>`__
in The Economist (which is one of the few mainstream magazines whose science
coverage is worth reading [#]_).

.. [#] Actually, I think it's the only one who can be consistently trusted, but
   I enjoy anything by Ed Yong wherever he publishes and been reading some
   excellent articles by Carl Zimmer in The Atlantic.
