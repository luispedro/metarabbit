    If it were discovered tomorrow that potatoes cured cancer, then people
    wouldn’t “suppress” this “natural” remedy. Two years from now there would
    be an ultrapurified potato extract called POTAXOR™®© that was, on closer
    examination, physically and chemically identical to mashed potatoes. But
    these mashed potatoes would be mashed in a giant centrifuge by scientists
    with five Ph. Ds each. Any time someone got cancer, their doctor would
    prescribe POTAXOR™®© and charge $6,000 per dose, and the patient would get
    better, and the thought of just going out and eating a potato would never
    occur to anybody. Not to the doctor, who doesn’t want to sound like the
    idiot who tells her cancer patients to eat potatoes. Not to the FDA, who
    doesn’t know whether potatoes might be contaminated with lead or potato
    fungus or ketchup or God-knows-what. And certainly not to the patient. They
    would have to pay 60 cents for a potato at the supermarket, but if they
    have a good enough insurance the POTAXOR™®© is free!

I remember a speaker from a pharmaceutical company once saying:

    We do not charge for the pills. With a few exceptions, pills go for a few
    cents each. However, the little foldable paper insert with small print
    listing all the side-effects and some other information? *That cost a
    billion dollars or more.* We charge for that.

2. More Slate Start Codex, from a completely `unrelated post
<http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/14/living-by-the-sword/>`__ about people
behaving like caricatures, we have this gem:

    why don’t whales get cancer more often?

    I mean, think about it. Cancer results from a series of mutations occurring
    by chance in a single cell. So over a given time period, the cancer rate of
    an organism should be proportional to the number of cells in that organism.
    If a whale is a thousand times bigger than a person, it should have a
    thousand times more cells and therefore get cancer a thousand times more
    often. [...]

    I don’t know which of the various proposed solutions to this puzzle is true
    but the most hilarious is no doubt Nagy, Victor and Cropper (2007). [...]
    [T]he theory is that whales survive because they are so big that their
    cancers get cancer and die.
