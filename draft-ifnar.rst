During the break, another paper where I played a part came out:

    *Host-cell sensors for Plasmodium activate innate immunity against
    liver-stage infection* by Liehl et al., in Nature Medicine (2013) `[DOI]
    <http://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3424>`__

This was quite cool.

Plasmodium falciparum, the malaria causing parasite, when entering the human
body, first infects the liver. There, the small number of initial parasites
