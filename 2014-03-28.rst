`Swanson Premimum RNA & DNA <http://www.swansonvitamins.com/swanson-premium-rna-dna-100-10-mg-250-tabs>`__

Don't forget to read the reviews:

    "I noticed a difference right away. I have more energy, it has helped to
    lessen my appetite, and my skin took on a healthy glow. I recommend this
    product to anyone, especially siting the value. I'm glad I tried it."
    
Some costumers like to live dangerously:

    "I felt a slight boost to my energy level . I had to take one pill twice a
    day to feel the slight boost of energy . More than the recommended one pill
    once a day."

This guy is taking a whole 20mg of DNA per day!

This led me to wonder which regularly-consumed foods are naturally
high-DNA/RNA, but my thoughts on the high-DNA front quickly became
inappropriate for this family-friendly blog.
