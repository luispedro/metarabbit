1. A last `link on the facebook saga
   <http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/the-facebook-study-sampling-and-the-principle-of-delayed-decision/>`__
   makes the observation that if facebook just includes some randomness in all
   decisions of what to show on the stream (which they might do just to improve
   their service), then any study which leverages this is a randomized
   observational study. And observational studies have much reduced ethical
   thresholds.

2. An excellent `summary of what is known about SSRIs
   <http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/ssris-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/>`__.
   I really liked both the conversion of effect size to weight loss numbers and
   the discussion of how, whilst people can agree on the data, it gets very
   hairy when you start to use words such as "moderate depression" or "severe
   depression" to describe different numeric results.

3. Some people who make more money than I do, can `activate your DNA
   <http://dnaperfection.com/>`__. Obviously, they are skeptical of ENCODE
   claims. This guy's biography is perfect:

        Toby Alexander, is a coach, speaker, seminar leader and author. He is a
        leading expert in a variety of fields including energy medicine,
        emotional mastery, peak mental strategies for optimal performance, 15th
        dimensional physics, futures and forex trading, SAP, remote viewing,
        and distant healing.

    SAP, forex trading, and distant healing?

4. Next week, I'll be in Lisbon for `LxMLS 2014 <http://lxmls.it.pt/2014/>`__.
   Contact me if you want to get in touch there.
