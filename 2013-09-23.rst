Over the last few posts, I described my nuclear segmentation paper.

It has a `reproducible research archive
<https://github.com/luispedro/segmentation>`__.

If you now download that code, **that is not the code that was used for the
paper**!

In fact, the version that generates the tables in the paper does not run
anymore, because it only runs with old versions of numpy!

In order for it to compute the computation in the paper, I had to update the
code. In order to run the code in the paper, you need to get old versions of
software.

To some extent, this is due to numpy's frustrating lack of forward
compatibility [#]_. The issue at hand was the changed semantics of the
histogram function.

In the end, I think I completely avoided that function in my code for a few
years as it was toxic (when you write `libraries for others <>`__, you never
know which version of numpy they are running).

But as much as I can gripe about numpy breaking code between minor versions,
they would eventually be justified in changing their API with the next major
version change.

In the end, the half-life of code is such that each year, it becomes harder to
reproduce older papers even if the code is available.

.. [#] I used to develop for the KDE project where **you did not break user's
   code ever** and so I find it extremely frustrating to have to explain that
   you should not change an API on esthetical grounds in between minor
   versions.
