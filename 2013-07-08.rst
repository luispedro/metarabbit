A fairly long interview with me was published last week in Portuguese at
`colisor
<http://colisor.blogspot.com/2013/07/livros-emigracao-ciencia-politica-e.html>`__.
It talk about `my upcoming book
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/building-machine-learning-systems-with-python/>`__,
Portugal and EMBL.

It is in Portuguese, but I translated (semi-manually: first google translate,
then fixed it) some sections, which I thought could be interesting:

I discussed motivation in general:

    I think that the ability to self-motivate will become an increasingly important
    factor for success. I speak not only of professional success, but also some
    personal satisfaction (how many times you hear "I always thought I would like
    to someday...").  With the internet and digital technology, large doors opened
    up for those able to work self-motivated.

    We can learn a huge amount without paying anything for it, we can create music and put
    online, we can make a movie for little money, we can write a book with a laptop
    ... If the aim is to become famous or get rich, it is difficult. But, if we
    want to do something for the small community of people who are interested in
    the same topic that we (either machine learning or music that fuses fado and
    electronic sounds) then today can reach this community with fewer barriers. But
    it is there work that it takes to get there.

    One thing that helps me is `Beeminder <http://beeminder.com>`_-. Another thing
    that helps is social pressure. It is a powerful force: I told lot of people
    around me that was writing. So when you ask "so the book?" you put some
    pressure. Good powers go saying "I just finished a chapter" rather than "do not
    even look at it for months."

(This is basically why I my daughter goes to a Montesorri school).

I also talked about the problems in Portugal. I also still stand behind what I
previously `wrote in my earlier blog
<http://www.mutualinformation.org/2011/02/whats-wrong-with-portugal/>`__:

    The institutional infrastructure in Portugal is bad (the physical
    infrastructure is good, but I think the country has reached the limit of what
    is possible to do more physical infrastructure). There are many very well
    qualified people and they could be very capable of doing things, but without
    infrastructure ...

    At one point, in mid-November I told a student: "try to decide what you want to
    order as soon as possible, otherwise only by ith middle of January will we get
    it". This was to order a small electronic equipment that could be purchased in
    two hours by going to a store (and it would be so long because we
    wwould take the subway). In the U.S., we would have ordered online, with
    delivery within 3 days (or gone to the a store if we really needed it fast).
    But, because of the need to do this through a long series of intermediate
    (steps were still made by fax! In 2012), and with Christmas, there was a risk
    to take months. All this for a purchase of about 300 euros. I realized that
    being in Portugal I was doing wrong was beginning to think so.

Finally, a comment on that buzzword *excellence*:

    Another difference [between research in Portugal and at EMBL] is the culture of
    excellence. I think this word is often used to mean certain policy choice of
    hiring ("excellent" people), but I'd say that's to misunderstand the concept and
    try to "get excellence on the cheap" (without having to change anything).
    **Excellence is a collective phenomenon**. If a excellent person has to wait
    two months due to institutional impediments, the result will probably not be
    excellent.
