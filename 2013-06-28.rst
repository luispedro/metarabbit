1. This month's issue of `The Atlantic <http://www.theatlantic.com/>`__ could
be a Friday Links of its own as it is heavy on *science vs ignorance themes*:
Many `fertility and age "facts" are based on outdated science
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-long-can-you-wait-to-have-a-baby/309374/>`__
and a `fantastic defense of processed foods (against the likes Michael Pollan)
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-junk-food-can-end-obesity/309396/>`__.
The food article is "interesting throughout" and really highlights some of the
quasi religious non-thinking in the modern "foodie" movement (which is less and
less about food). The money quote is the McDonald's guy describing their need
to **choose between making healthier or more wholesome foods**.
