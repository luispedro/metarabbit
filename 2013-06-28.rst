1. This month's issue of `The Atlantic <http://www.theatlantic.com/>`__ could
be a Friday Links of its own as it is heavy on *science vs ignorance themes*:
Many `fertility and age "facts" are based on outdated science
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-long-can-you-wait-to-have-a-baby/309374/>`__
and a `fantastic defense of processed foods (against the likes Michael Pollan)
<http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/how-junk-food-can-end-obesity/309396/>`__.
The food article is "interesting throughout" and really highlights some of the
quasi religious non-thinking in the modern "foodie" movement (which is less and
less about food). The money quote is the McDonald's guy describing their need
to **choose between making healthier or more wholesome foods**.

2. If you missed it, read `Derek Lowe's takedown of some nutiness
<http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2013/06/21/eight_toxic_foods_a_little_chemical_education.php>`__.

Some choice quotes:

    This piece really is an education. Not about food, or about chemistry - on
    the contrary, reading it for those purposes will make you noticeably less
    intelligent than you were before, and consider that a fair warning. The
    educational part is in the "What a fool believes" category. Make no
    mistake: on the evidence of this article, its author is indeed a fool.

    You cannot assume anything about the effects of a chemical compound based
    on whether it came from a lovely rainforest orchid or out of a crusty
    Erlenmeyer flask. The world is not set up that way.

    In 2011, a study found that chicken meat with detectable levels of
    roxarsone [a feed additive] had 2.3 parts per billion (note the "b") of
    inorganic arsenic, which is the kind that is truly toxic. [...] But let's
    get things on scale: it's worth comparing these arsenic levels to those
    found in other foods. White rice, for example comes in at about 100 parts
    per billion of inorganic arsenic (and brown rice at 170 ppb). These, by the
    way, are all-natural arsenic levels, produced by the plant's own uptake
    from the soil. [...] If you're having chicken and rice and you want to
    worry about arsenic, worry about the rice.

We know that `vitalism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism>`__ is not true
`since 1828 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6hler_synthesis>`__. We need to
start teaching it to children in schools.
