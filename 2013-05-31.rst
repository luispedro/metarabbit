I wrote a book. Well, only in part, Willi Richert and I wrote a book.

It is called Building Machine Learning Systems With Python and is now available
from Amazon (or Amazon.co.uk), although it has already been partially available
directly from the publisher.

The book is an introduction to using machine learning in Python.

We mostly rely on scikit-learn, which is the most complete package for machine
learning in Python. I do prefer my own code for my own projects, but `milk
<>`__ is not as complete. It has stuff that scikit-learn does not (and stuff
they have, correctly, appropriated).

The approach is tutorial-like, without much math but code examples. We do
emphacise correct evaluation of the results. In fact, we repeatedly warn
against mixing up your training and testing data. This simple principle is,
unfortunately, still often disrespected in scientific publications. [#]_

There is an aspect that I really enjoyed about this whole process:

Before starting the book, I had already submitted two papers, neither of which
is out already (even though, after some revisions, they are in *accepted*
state). In the meanwhile, the book has been written, edited (only a few minor
issues are still pending) and people have been able to buy parts of it for a
few months now.

I have now a renewed confidence in the choice to stay in science (also because
I moved from a place where things are completely absurd to a place where the
work very well). But the delay in publications that is common in the life
sciences is an emotional drag.

.. [#] It is rare to see somebody just report training accuracy and claim their
   algorithm does well. However, performing feature selection or parameter
   tuning on the whole data prior to cross-validating on the selected features
   with the tuned parameters is pretty common still today. This leads to
   inflated results all around. One of the problems of doing things correctly
   is that reviewers of your work will then say "but so-and-so got better
   results" even if so-and-so did it incorrectly (yes, I've had this happen,
   multiple times); but that is a rant for another day.
