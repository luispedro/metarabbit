Motivation & Demotivation

When I was in high school, I didn't enjoy learning other languages that much.
I'd pick up enough to get decent grades, but it was not something I really
liked (I also had the advantage of being bilingual so that I never had to put
any effort towards learning English). When I tell this to people who know me
IRL they are sometimes surprised because, nowadays, note only do I speak three
languages on a regular day, I can go up to five on a good day and I enjoy
learning about them.

What changed? When I left high school and started traveling, I discovered that
*languages could be used to talk to people*. Like most life discoveries, it is
a basic fact of life, which I knew it already, but I didn't realize the
implications. My actually interacting with people in another tongue, I became
more interested in knowing the languages an. Eventually started enjoying the
details of the language for their own sake. The desire to talk to people
transferred to a desire to learn about their languages.

**Epilogue**: I now use this in an active way when I need to learn a whole new
field (like a year ago, when I started working on metagenomics). Instead of
relying solely on reading papers &c I will start attending seminaries even when
I don't yet understand much of what goes on, I try to get into the discussions
(naturally, at first, I just listen or ask questions; unable to really
contribute). Eventually, I start looking up stuff that people said on my own
and *boom!* I'm reading papers without any efforts.
