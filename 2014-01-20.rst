1. `We have shown... <http://georg.io/2014/01/PLoS_Biology_Author_Action/>`__
   and `citation counts in PLos Bioogy
   <http://georg.io/2014/01/PLoS_Biology_Citation_Counts/>`__ by Georg Walther.

2. `Obtaining antibiotics without a prescription
   <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200207183470319>`__ (I think the
   real problem is not that they are not regulated for human consumption, but
   the antibiotic overuse issue).

3. `An alternative way to distribute research money
   <http://embor.embopress.org/content/early/2014/01/07/embr.201338068>`__. I
   honestly do not know whether this would work and would be against a whole
   change switch to the system.

   However, I'd love to see some experimentation with this system. A funding
   agency could try it out on a small subset of their recipients to see if the
   possible preverse effects win out over the obvious benefits.

4. A small stab against chemophobia: `natural products with a list of
   ingredients
   <http://io9.com/what-if-natural-products-came-with-a-list-of-ingredient-1503320184>`__

        Anthocynanins, for example, which are said to give blueberries their
        "superfood" status, are also known as E163."
