This was going to be a link for a Friday Links, but it quickly expanded from a
comment to a longer piece.

A glimpse of the future. `Oh, no, it's algorithms!
<http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/entry/nurses-launch-new-campaign-to-alert-public-to-dangers-of-medical-technology/>`__

This is heavy on the tropes used against `evidence based medicine
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine>`__ in general [#]_, with
the basic argument being that "we cannot rely on conclusions from statistics
because each individual case is different".

The point that is more directly related to computers (or algorithms) is that
"algorithms are simple mathematical formulas that nobody understands".
Naturally, the "simple" was sarcastic, *simple mathematical formula* being an
oxymoron.

In fact, some of the algorithms can use a complex formula that nobody
understands. The systems get so complex that it starts to make sense to talk

This is pure `Nirvana fallacy
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy>`__, however. The alternatives
are either to (1) to use another super-complex system that nobody understands,
namely a doctor or nurse's brain or (2).

Also note this public choice story: *Observation is the latest fad in large
part because Medicare reimbursement penalties for patients re-admitted within
30 days for the same illness do not apply if the patient was discharged from an
observation unit*. `Goodhart's Law
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_Law>`__ strikes again.

.. [#] There are issues with evidence-based medicine, yes; but they are not as
       bad as the issues with the alternative.
