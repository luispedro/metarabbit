FAQ: How Many Clusters Did You Use?

    Luis Pedro Coelho, Joshua D. Kangas, Armaghan Naik, Elvira Osuna-Highley,
    Estelle Glory-Afshar, Margaret Fuhrman, Ramanuja Simha, Peter B. Berget,
    Jonathan W. Jarvik, and Robert F.  Murphy, *Determining the subcellular
    location of new proteins from microscope images using local features* in
    Bioinformatics, 2013 [`Advanced Access
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt392>`__]
    
    Coelho, Luis Pedro, Tao Peng, and Robert F. Murphy. “Quantifying the
    Distribution of Probes Between Subcellular Locations Using Unsupervised Pattern
    Unmixing.” Bioinformatics 26.12 (2010): i7–i12. `DOI:

Both of my Bioinformatics papers above use the concept of `bag of visual words
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision>`__. The
first for classification, the second for `pattern unmixing
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/old-work-unsupervised-subcellular-pattern-unmixing/>`__.

Visual words are formed by clustering local appearance descriptors. The
descriptors may have different origins (see the papers above and the references
below), but the clustering is the same.
