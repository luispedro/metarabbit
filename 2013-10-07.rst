Mahotas and the Python Scientific Ecosystem for Bioimage Analysis

This week, I'm in Barcelona to talk about mahotas at the `EuBIAS 2013 Meeting
<http://eubias2013.irbbarcelona.org/>`__.

You can get a preview of my talk `here
<http://luispedro.org/files/talks/2013/EuBIAS/mahotas.html>`__. You'll see it
does not exclusively talks about mahotas, but the whole ecosystem. Comments are
welcome (especially if they come in the next 24 hours).

In preparation, I released new versions of mahotas (and the sister
mahotas-imread) yesterday:

- `Mahotas 1.0.3 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mahotas/>`__
- `imread 0.3.2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/imread>`__

There are a few bugfixes and small improvements throughout.
