The starving artist with the rich dad is not just a made stereotype, but we
scientists grew up richer than all those chavs (which is why it's so common to
see young scientists aghast at getting an above-median salary [see link #4 in a
`previous Friday Links
<https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/friday-links-14/>`__]: they just
grew up with very high expectations).

Also, generally on topics where the data is shaky, like nutrition. As I wrote
`last year <http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/friday-links-3/>`__:

    One of my top scientific peeves is the over-selling of weak results in
    public health, especially in nutrition. I think this is more damaging to
    the cause of evidence based policy than almost any anti-science group. Many
    people will say things like “I don’t trust scientists: first it was don’t
    eat olive oil, now olive oil is good. No peanuts, yes to peanuts, now no to
    peanuts again; science is just whatever is fashionable, really."
