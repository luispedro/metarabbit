# 2014 in Review

## Papers

2014 was slowish, compared to
[2013](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/01/08/year-in-review-my-papers/),
but I have a few big things in the pipeline (one accepted, another in minor
revisions, and the second edition of [our
book](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/building-machine-learning-systems-with-python/)
incorporating all errata and some other improvements is almost done).

Still, several projects I was involved with finally got their papers out in
2014:

1. *Metagenomic insights into the human gut resistome and the forces that shape
   it* by Kristoffer Forslund, Shinichi Sunagawa, **Luis Pedro Coelho**, and
   Peer Bork in Bioessays (2014)
   [DOI:10.1002/bies.201300143](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.201300143/abstract)

   We looked at the presence of antibiotic resistance potential and how it
   correlates with animal antibiotic usage across countries.

2. *Trypanosoma brucei histone H1 inhibits RNA polymerase I transcription and
   is important for parasite fitness in vivo* by Pena AC, Pimentel MR, Manso
   H, Vaz-Drago R, Neves D, Aresta-Branco F, Ferreira FR, Guegan F, Coelho LP,

## Blogposts

The most read blog post during 2014 was (Why Python is Better than Matlab for
Scientific
Software)[https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/why-python-is-better-than-matlab-for-scientific-software/].

For the posts written in 2014, the most read was [this comment on
modernity](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/modernity/), which had a
less-read
[follow-up](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/modernity-ii/).

The post that was hardest to write was [talking about an academic dry
spell](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/dealing-with-a-dry-spell/).

## Other

I did a bit of traveling, giving talks in Leuven, Paris, and San Sebastian, and
teaching software carpentry in,
[Denmark](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/denmark/),
[Cyprus](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-past-is-another-country-you-take-a-plane-to-get-there/)
and Jordan. San Sebastian was a fantastic place (I had never really gotten the
appeal of the *independently wealthy* life until I visited San Sebastian).

Another interesting thing I did was a [webcast on linear regression, including
the funky kind, in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3117). It was an
interesting experience, maybe I'll do it again.

## Most importantly

Normally, I try to leave my personal life out of this blog (and the public
internets), but 2014 was also remarkable for the birth of our second daughter,
Sarah.
