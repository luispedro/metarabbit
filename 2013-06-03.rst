How long do papers take to review?

Too long.

No, seriously, how long? I did a little measurement. I downloaded the 360 most
recent papers from Plos One (as of Friday). They are all annotated with
*submission* and *acceptance* dates, so it was easy to just compute the
differences.

The plot below is a histogram (one bin per day) in grey with a Kernel density
estimate as a solid line.

The result is **it takes about 3 to 4 months to get a paper accepted, but with
substancial variance**.

Looking at the figure, I had to ask who the poor people were who published that
paper which was longest in revision.

    Alternative Sigma Factor Over-Expression Enables Heterologous Expression of
    a Type II Polyketide Biosynthetic Pathway in *Escherichia coli* by 

Submitted on *29 March 2011* and accepted on *22 April 2013*, this paper was
755 days in revision.

This is a gimmick. There is perhaps a paper to be written where this is
extended to see what areas of research/keywords/&c matter to acceptance time.
If I had more free time I might write that paper (Get in touch if you want to
write it with me).
