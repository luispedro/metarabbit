2. Oldy, but interesting: `A report on a clinical trial of quack medication for
   cancer
   <http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/gonzalez-regimen-for-cancer-of-the-pancreas-even-worse-than-we-thought-part-ii-loose-ends/>`__.

This is interesting:

    It was originally conceived as a randomized, controlled trial comparing the
    “Gonzalez Regimen” to standard chemotherapy for cancer of the pancreas. In
    the first year, however, only 2 subjects had been accrued, purportedly
    because those seeking Gonzalez’s treatment were not willing to risk random
    assignment to the chemotherapy arm.

We often think that the ethical issue with randomized trials is that it assigns
some people to a useless placebo, but here the problem is that people refused
to get the medication and demanded the placebo.

For me this also undermines much of the dicussion of ethics in that post (but
not the interestingness of the story). Perhaps studying this was against
ethical rules, but not it is not so clear what was unethical in the sense of
immoral.

5. `Anti-science propaganda on your yogurts

The bit about "evaporated cane juice" is not specific to this company, though.
Many many products use this euphemism for sugar. I also agree with `Derek Lowe
<http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/06/05/get_the_science_out_of_your_yogurt.php>`__

    The slogan itself is annoying, but what gets me more are the attitudes
    behind it. First, of course, is the "Science = icky" assumption, which
    seems to be just taken for granted by whoever wrote this thing. Its author
    also trusted everyone who read it to make the same connection, which isn't
    too comforting, either.
