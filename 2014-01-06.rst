Megan McArdle:

    As I’ve remarked before, it’s not surprising that so many academics believe
    that the American workplace is a desperately oppressive and exploitative
    environment in which employers can endlessly abuse workers without fear of
    reprisal, or of losing the workers. That’s a pretty accurate description of
    the job market for academic labor ... until you have tenure.

Semi-tongue-in-cheek, I might add that it is also not surprising that many
academics think that big companies can use advertisement/propaganda to
manipulate their customers into over-paying for worthless products. That's a
pretty good description of a modern liberal-arts degree at any non-top-tier
school (and even at the top tier, it's debatable).

(The referenced `post by The Professor is In
<http://theprofessorisin.com/2014/01/01/how-the-tenured-are-to-the-job-market-as-white-people-are-to-racism/>`__
is a mix of unintended self-parody of liberal academics and some praise-worthy
self-reflection.)
