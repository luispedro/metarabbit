1. `Fraud and rankings
<http://citationculture.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/may-university-rankings-help-uncover-problematic-or-fraudulent-research/>`__

Whenever there is fraud uncovered & reported, it is always on very brazen
level. Is it 

a. Small fraud is uncovered all the time, but it doesn't really make the intertubes.
b. Fraudsters always overdo it. They just get carried away.
c. Small fraud (faking this or that figure in mid-rank journals) is undetected.

I figure it's option c.
