A Note On Predatory Publishers

There are two types of predatory publishers:

1. The truly predatory. These are the guys who build a website with the same
name as a real journal, copy its editorial board and wait for scientists to
make a mistake. Or who have conferences with the same name and organizing
committee as a real conference (except for a hyphen or some other minor thing;
the committee is still fake, though).

This is the publishers preying on trusting authors story. This is, by far, the
**minority**.

2. The low quality (or perhaps no quality) journals. This is what most of
Beall's list is actually about.

This is **the publishers and the authors*** preying on the scientific system
and often preying on taxpayer's money! The authors *are accomplices and not
victims of predatory publishers*.

The people who submit there generally know what they're getting. Or at least
they should know. [#]_

If you are at a third rate institution with third rate supervision and your
work is third rate, this is win-win-lose: you win because you get a publication
(which you can tout to your funders), they win because they get the publishing
fees, and the taxpayer who paid for it loses. The taxpayer loses even more if
this outlet is an excuse for you to not do the kind of good work that would get
you in a real journal.

This is, naturally, a bigger problem at non-first world institutions [#]_. The
work is not as strong and the supervision is weaker, thus you can fool the
bureacracy by pointing to all of the shitty not-really-peer-reviewed papers you
published (or the bureacracy understands and helps you fool the politicians;
it's fools all the way up).

However, it can happen in the US as well. The story of ASDASDAS seems to be
similar: the professors knew they weren't really getting peer-reviewed, the
departments knew, but they went through the motions to be able to claim that
*our faculty publishes in peer-reviewed journals*.  The fact that it was a
private institution does not change the basic point that it is the tax payer
paying. Its college students get taxpayer subsidized loans (which go to pay for
these publishing fees).

.. [#] There is always the possibility of publishing in a barely-known journal
   that's starting out because you think it shows promise and later realizing
   that it is actually a bad journal with little peer review. You can minimize
   the risk for it by looking at who is editor, &c; but sometimes you might
   really make a mistake. This is not what we are discussing here, though.

.. [#] I might get some pushback on this, but seriously: a country that had
   strong institutions and, on average, good work would be a first world
   country. That's what being first world means! (Yes, there are exceptions;
   but there are more problems in non-first world countries).
