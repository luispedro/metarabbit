Personalized Medicine Will be Depersonalized Medicince

It probably does not make sense to have MDs continue to provide vast amounts of
customer service. Imagine if the network engineers at google had to spend 30

Sure, they might tailor the network protocols to better serve the users, but
would they have the time to even keep up with what's happening in their field?
