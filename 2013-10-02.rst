Why Science is a Third World Economy

Because people are cheap and things are expensive.

To a large extent, it is easier to get money to pay for people (salaries [#]_)
than to pay for things. Other times, people show up who are willing to work
without being paid (they are self-funded). But then you need to get them
materials to work with. For that, you need to actually spend some money.

So, the discussions often feel very much like the third-world: a lot of people
standing around, replacement of capital by labour.

A while back I read a review which was comparing several technologies for the
same measurement task [#]_. There were two high-quality methods in terms of the
output. One was very automated but required you buy some kit (~$400), the
other was artisanal.

The authors wrote that the first one was good because it was very fast, but
expensive. The other one took a long time, but was cheap. They didn't even
price the cost of labour! They didn't even ask how many hours of graduate
student time you can get for $400.

Which, of course, makes some sense in the public-funded bureaucratic world
where money is `not fungible <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility>`__. You
cannot often reallocate money from stipends to materials.

.. [#] or stipends which are exactly like a salary, except for tax purposes.

.. [#] I could probably find it now if I looked, but I don't actually want to
   lose track of the main point.
