Nonspecific Citations

A common problem with antibody is non-specific binding: while the antibody may
be targetted to grab on to protein P, it actually also grabs X, Y, and Z, which
are somewhat similar to P.

A non-specific citation is when paper gets cited as an example of a broad class
rather than for its specific ideas.

§

In the case of a review article, it might make some sense: if you are just
mentioning the field, you might as well cite `my review of bioimage informatics
<http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-13131-8_2>`__. Even here,
though, you could cite other reviews.

In the case of the research articles, though, it is often more of a *throwaway
citation*: we need to mention work in the area of cell image analysis and I
have a recent paper out on this, so you cite that.

§

There are intermediate levels of specificity. Maybe you are writing a paper
that somehow touts the general usefulness of local features and you write a
sentence such as:

    Local features are useful (or SURF has been used) in many context such as A
    [paper], B [paper], and cell image analysis [my work].

§

This will of course lead to a citation Matthew Effect: if you are highly cited,
you are likely to get even more citations.
