Easterlin Paradox

Here is the difference between undergraduate calculus and graduate economics:

**Undergraduate calculus**

Let *f* be a function from the positive reals to a closed interval [a,b]. Prove
that if *f* is monotonically increasing, its derivative goes to zero.

**Graduate economics**

Let *f* be a function from the positive reals to a closed interval [a,b]. Note
that even when *f* is monotonically increasing, its derivative goes to zero.
