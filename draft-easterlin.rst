Easterlin Paradox

Here is the difference between undergraduate calculus and graduate economics:

**Undergraduate calculus**

Let *f* be a function from the positive reals to a closed interval [a,b]. Prove
that if *f* is monotonically increasing, its derivative goes to zero.

**Graduate economics**

Let *f* be a function from the positive reals to a closed interval [a,b]. Note
that even when *f* is monotonically increasing, its derivative goes to zero.

the policy implications of this fact.

(The Easterlin Paradox is the observation that when you ask people who happy
they are on a scale from 1 to 10, this happiness value first grows fast with
higher incomes, but then it plateaus. It doesn't grow forever.)
