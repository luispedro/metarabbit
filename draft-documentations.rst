A good poker player *polarizes his hands*. This means that, for example, they
might play a check-raise (this means you first *refrain from betting* and then
come over the top on your opponentâ€”This is normally done to give the impression
that you have a strong hand) when they do have a very strong hand or when they
completely missed the flop (they have very bad cards and are just bluffing).
Intermediate hands are played differently [#]_

Hard Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is low level documentation, generally. This is of the kind that a Unix
manpage gets you. This tells you **exactly** what each function and each
argument does. If it is good, it will often be very succint.

Mahotas has always excelled at this level.

This is because I can remember the general ideas behind each function, but I
might like to look up.


Soft Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The Intermediate Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't care so much for intermediate level documentation. I rarely find that
level helpful. Unfortunately, this is the level at which too much bad
documentation is written.


.. [#] The reason for the randomness is that if you always do a single thing,
    people will catch on and exploit it (if you bluff a lot, people will call
    it; if you always have a strong hand, then you won't get the added benefit
    of having someone try to call your bluff and give you even more chips).
    Intermediate hands should not be played like this because if the opponent
    pushes back, they probably have something that beats your intermediate
    hand. As always in poker, YMMV.
