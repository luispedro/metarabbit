1. `Bioimage informatics conferences in Leuven
<http://www.vibconferences.be/event/bioimage-informatics>`__ and `in Oporto
<http://www.bioimaging.biostec.org/>`__

2. `BBC Horizon 1977-1978 on the introduction of computers
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5Fvk8FNOQ>`__ The only thing that is
outdated about this documentary are the fashions. Mike Cooley, an union leader
claims:

    It may be necessary for individual nation-states to make clear decisions
    about what kind of development and society they want, and, if necessary, be
    prepared to protect themselves from the ruthless introduction of this kind
    of equipment [automation using computers] by the multinational
    corporations.


3. New face of biology? Outsource `wetlab work
<http://recode.net/2014/06/30/founders-fund-backs-a-robotic-lab-that-puts-science-in-the-cloud/>`__,
keep analysis in house? For many studies this makes way more sense than the
often proposed opposite (do wetlab in house, outsource analysis to the cloud).
