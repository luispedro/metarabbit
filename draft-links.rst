Let me fish out one paragraph:

     [I]n 1967 Stanley Milgram did an experiment to determine the number of
     degrees of separation between two people in the U.S. In his experiment he
     sent 296 letters to people in Omaha, Nebraska and Wichita, Kansas. The
     goal was to get the letters to a specific person in Boston, Massachusetts.
     The trick was people had to send the letters to someone they knew, and
     they then sent it to someone they knew and so on. At the end of the
     experiment, only 64 letters made it to the individual in Boston. On
     average, the letters had gone through 6 people to get there. This is where
     the idea of “6-degrees of Kevin Bacon” comes from. Based on 64 data
     points.  A 2007 study updated that number to “7 degrees of Kevin Bacon”.
     The study was based on 30 billion instant messaging conversations
     collected over the course of a month or two with the same amount of effort

What really jumps at me is how close the values were between the 1967
experiment (with so few datapoints, immensily biased: they only took the ones
that got there!) and the 2007 version (whose conclusion is actually **6.6**).
