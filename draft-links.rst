1. `Journal/Author Name Estimator <http://www.biosemantics.org/jane/>`__

Interestingly, I tried the name of my recent Bioinformatics paper and it
matched it Bioinformatics (I checked and it is not in its database, perhaps
because it is officially still "Advanced Access"). When I tried the working
title (which we used in the first submission), Bioinformatics was only number
3.
