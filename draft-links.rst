It is interesting that correct papers get retracted for ethical reasons, but
rarely just because they are wrong.

2. More `non-computational thinking, the stupid snob edition

    David Salz’s thoroughly researched assault on USB’s sonic handicaps
    delivers a relaxed, well-defined, dynamically evocative, and rhythmically
    taut performance. The Silver Starlight projects strings without
    screechiness, which cannot be said of most USB cables. For those seeking a
    mid-priced USB cable with obviously high build-quality and performance, the
    Silver Starlight is a solid choice.

The Silver Starlight USB **digital** cable costs $275/m!
