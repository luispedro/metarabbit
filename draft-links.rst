1. `Walmart Temple of Pseudoscience

    There’s a sign in the Durham store suggesting that shoppers [..] grind
    their organic coffees at home because the Whole Foods grinders process
    conventional coffee, too, and so might transfer some non-organic dust.
    “This slicer used for cutting both CONVENTIONAL and ORGANIC breads” warns a
    sign above the Durham location’s bread slicer. Synagogue kitchens are the
    only other places in which I’ve seen signs implying that level of
    food-separation purity.
