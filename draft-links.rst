BSD?

I am posting because I found it interesting, not because I agree.

I actually found it a bit na√Øve that the guy did not know what open access
really meant.  If one is publishing in an open access journal, one should know
what CC-BY means.

GPL for scientific papers?

3. A scientist associated with a certain idea that is gaining traction says

idea

4. From a post about the `IMF & Academia <http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=22081>`__:

    Just as Canadians know much more about the US, than Americans know about
    Canada, bloggers know much more about academia than academics know about
    the blogosphere. 

As with the previous link, my purpose here is to about the scientific aspect,
not the politics.
