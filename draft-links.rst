2. More on the `commercial reuse of open access papers <http://proteinsandwavefunctions.blogspot.dk/2013/07/commercial-reuse-of-published.html>`__

I have always thought that the biggest problem with the *non-commercial*
clauses is that it is so hard to define what it means. When I released the
materials for `Programming for Scientists
<https://github.com/luispedro/Programming-for-Scientists>`__, I added `a clause
saying <http://luispedro.org/pfs/copyright.html>`__ that *use in a class at an
accredited degree granting institution is also permissible*. It was not clear
to me that teaching a course at a university is a non-commercial activity. If
you think that a university *obviously is not* a commercial enterprise, I
invite you to argue your case, not in the comments of the blog, but after
enrolling and receiving a tuition bill. So, if your paper is CC-BY-NC, can I
distribute it to students in my class?

Obviously, I don't mean *can I go ahead and ignore your license without
realistic fear of getting sued*. I mean, this is a weird grey area.
