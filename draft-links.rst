   review of the many ways in which DNA-seq & RNA-seq library preparation methods are biased

2. `Current Practice in Software Development for Computational Neuroscience and
   How to Improve It
   <http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003376>`__

My first thought was that it is silly that we have these *Current Practice in
Software Development in [Subfield of Field]* papers when the issues are not
that different between fields. However, this paper does have a few quite
interesting thoughts which are as applicable to Computational Biology as to
Computational Neuroscience.

3. `Is post publication criticism of work cyberbullying?
<http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2014/01/04/reanalysis-science/>`__

Part of the problem is with with how broad people have been interpreting the
notion `of cyberbullying
<http://www.popehat.com/2012/03/29/in-which-i-dare-connecticut-to-come-get-me-come-at-me-bro/>`__:
 
     A person commits electronic harassment when such person, with intent to
     harass, annoy or alarm another person, transmits, posts, displays or
     disseminates, by or through an electronic communication device [...] which
     [...] (5) Has the effect of causing substantial embarrassment or
     humiliation to that person within an academic or professional community.

(See `popehat for a less measured take on this issue
<http://www.volokh.com/2012/03/30/connecticut-legislature/>`__. And, yes, this
bill did not become law [and, if it did, it would be have been struck down as
unconstitutional, but the point is that people seriously proposed it.)
