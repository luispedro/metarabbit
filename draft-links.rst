1. `Walmart Temple of Pseudoscience

    There’s a sign in the Durham store suggesting that shoppers [..] grind
    their organic coffees at home because the Whole Foods grinders process
    conventional coffee, too, and so might transfer some non-organic dust.
    “This slicer used for cutting both CONVENTIONAL and ORGANIC breads” warns a
    sign above the Durham location’s bread slicer. Synagogue kitchens are the
    only other places in which I’ve seen signs implying that level of
    food-separation purity.

2. `Faith & Reason

Money quote:

    [A] survey of 1,700 scientists at Harvard, MIT and other
    elite colleges [reported that a]bout a third were atheists (as opposed to
    fewer than one-in-20 ordinary Americans) [...]

    [A] still-larger study into science and religion [...] sought out
    “rank-and-file” scientists: researchers in company labs, engineers,
    dentists and so on. [Surprisingly], Main Street scientists are only a bit
    less religious than the average American. Perhaps Ivy League scientists are
    ultra-secular because they are Ivy League, not because they are scientists?
