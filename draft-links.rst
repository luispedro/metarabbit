1. `Should Science put up with sloppiness?
<http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/23/should-science-put-up-with-sloppiness/>`__

It is interesting that correct papers get retracted for ethical reasons, but
rarely just because they are wrong.

2. `Fraud & Science <http://m.sciencemag.org/content/341/6150/1043.full>`__

    The proposal, submitted some years earlier to a funding agency on a
    different continent, was copied by one of the reviewers, a highly
    recognized scientist, and then submitted to the ERC. It was pure chance
    that the former applicant detected the fraud.

    [...] However, the larger legal framework of the European Commission (EC)
    under which the ERC operates links "frauds" only to financial aspects. The
    ERC is then obliged to report any (accomplished or attempted) misbehavior
    to OLAF, the European antifraud police. Financial fraud, however, causes
    the least headaches. In the above case, the ERC was unable to take action
    against the mischievous applicant.

3. Another weird `science fraud case
<http://www.nature.com/news/mystery-over-obesity-fraud-1.13810>`__:

     The authors of a paper published in July [...] are not only unknown at the
     institution listed on the paper, but no trace of them as researchers can
     be found.

     The paper [...] is not the kind of prank that journals have encountered
     before, in which hoaxsters have submitted dummy papers to highlight
     weaknesses in the peer-review process. The paper’s reported findings [...]
     are, in fact, true.

     Bruce Spiegelman [...] says that he has presented similar findings at
     about six research meetings, and is preparing to submit them to a journal.
     He suspects that the [paper by unknown authors] was intended as a spoiler
     of his own lab’s work.


3. More `non-computational thinking, the stupid snob edition
<http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/2013-tas-editors-choice-awards-digital-interconnects/>`__

    David Salz’s thoroughly researched assault on USB’s sonic handicaps
    delivers a relaxed, well-defined, dynamically evocative, and rhythmically
    taut performance. The Silver Starlight projects strings without
    screechiness, which cannot be said of most USB cables. For those seeking a
    mid-priced USB cable with obviously high build-quality and performance, the
    Silver Starlight is a solid choice.

The Silver Starlight USB **digital** cable costs $275/m!
