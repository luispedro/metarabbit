1. `Do android suffer from visual illusions?
   <http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/7352-the-flaw-lurking-in-every-deep-neural-net.html>`__

The style of the article does remind me of the classic `one weird kernel trick
<http://oneweirdkerneltrick.com/>`__ website.

2. Is Python doomed? Two arguments for the prosecution: `Python 3 is killing
Python <https://medium.com/@deliciousrobots/5d2ad703365d>`__ (the mess that was
the switch from Python 2 to Python 3 is a good example of why software
engineering is so hard). `Performance matters

3. So much for the Mediterranean Diet? `Greece and Italy have highest childhood
obesity rates in the OECD <http://www.oecd.org/health/obesity-update.htm>`__
Portugal and Spain clock in a bit lower, but still well above Northern Europe
(the tables are ordered by male obesity [which tend to be higher in developed
countries]; when it comes to girls, Portugal does has a very high obesity rate
[which is typical countries under development]).

4. On October 22, I'll do a webcast on `Penalized Regression in Python
<http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3117>`__ for O'Reilly.
