1. `On reproducibility and incentives <http://andrewgelman.com/2013/07/28/50-shades-of-gray-a-research-story/>`__

The linked `position paper <http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/615.full>`__ has
an interesting discussion of incentives [#]_:

    Publishing a result does not make it true. Many published results have
    uncertain truth value. Dismissing a direct replication as "we
    already knew that" is misleading; the actual criticism is "someone has
    already claimed that."

They also discuss how for-profit actors (pharma and biotech) have better incentives to replicate:

    Investing hundreds of thousands of dollars on a new treatment that is
    ineffective is a waste of resources and an enormous burden to patients in
    experimental trials. By contrast, for academic researchers there are few
    consequences for being wrong. If replications get done and the original
    result is irreproducible nothing happens.

2. A `takedown of a PNAS paper <http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2013/08/05/improving-your-health-by-pursuing-meaning-versus-happiness/>`__:

    If, as an Academic Editor for PLOS One I had received this article as a
    manuscript, I would probably have recommended Rejection without sending it
    out for further review. But if I had sent the manuscript out for review, I
    would have chosen at least some reviewers with relevant psychometric
    backgrounds.

Ouch!

By the way, the linked publication has a very high `altmetric score
<http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1657565&src=bookmarklet>`__
(top 5% and it was only published last week).

.. [#] I quote from the preprint on arXiv, I hope it hasn't changed in the final version.
