2. Oldy, but interesting: `A report on a clinical trial of quack medication for
   cancer
   <http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/gonzalez-regimen-for-cancer-of-the-pancreas-even-worse-than-we-thought-part-ii-loose-ends/>`__.

This is interesting:

    It was originally conceived as a randomized, controlled trial comparing the
    “Gonzalez Regimen” to standard chemotherapy for cancer of the pancreas. In
    the first year, however, only 2 subjects had been accrued, purportedly
    because those seeking Gonzalez’s treatment were not willing to risk random
    assignment to the chemotherapy arm.

We often think that the ethical issue with randomized trials is that it assigns
some people to a placebo, but here the problem is that people refused to get
the medication.

For me this also undermines much of the dicussion of ethics in that post (but
not the interestingness of the story). Perhaps studying this was against
ethical rules, but not it is not so clear what was unethical in the sense of
immoral.
