1. More ways that `anti-science people hurt their own children

    That is about as spectacular a parenting fail as letting your child go
    through a windshield head first in a car accident because you thought
    refusing to buckle your child in a car seat made you look
    *educated*.

I, for one, refuse to fall for the lies of the seatbelt lobby.

I was surprised at the level of specialization demonstrated:

    Some young scientists say that to increase their flexibility, they're
    focusing less on identifying themselves with a particular type of
    physics—for example, neutrino physics or collider physics—and more on
    developing a broadly applicable skill set. For example, Penning, who works
    on the ATLAS detector at the LHC, says that with his experience in collider
    physics he has gained expertise in sifting out small numbers of "signal"
    events from huge numbers of spurious "background" events. He's already
    thinking about how such skills might translate to other types of
    experiments, he says.

I thought he was going to say "non-physics applications".
