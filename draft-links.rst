1. `The Life Cycle of Medical Ideas
<http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/09/12/the-life-cycle-of-medical-ideas/>`__

    I was always taught that there were two kinds of medicine. Real medicine,
    which has been proven to work by studies. And alternative medicine, which
    has been proven not to work by studies but people still use it anyway
    because they are stupid.

    This dichotomy leaves out the huge grey area of "things that seem like they
    will probably work, and a few smaller studies have shown very promising
    results, but no one has bothered to do larger studies, or if they
    have they have never really been incorporated into medical practice for
    reasons I can't put my finger on."

2. `Don't Use Hadoop, Your Data Isn't That Big
<http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html>`__

What is big data can quickly devolve into penis size comparisons (*my data is
bigger than yours*), but if your data fits in RAM it's not big, it's hardly
even data.

3. Related: `Bayes and Big Data
<http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/1046.html>`__. I think
it's interesting, but (i) there is a lot of effort in quasi-Bayesian method
[#]_ and (ii) small data is still very important.


.. [#] Quasi-Bayesian is a term I coined just now to mean approximate Bayesian
   for computation tractability.
