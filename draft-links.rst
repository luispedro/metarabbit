1. `Journal/Author Name Estimator <http://www.biosemantics.org/jane/>`__

Interestingly, I tried the name of my recent Bioinformatics paper and it
matched it Bioinformatics (I checked and it is not in its database, perhaps
because it is officially still "Advanced Access"). When I tried the working
title (which we used in the first submission), Bioinformatics was only number
3.

2. `Sight over sound in the judgment of music performance
<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/08/16/1221454110.short>`__ by Chia-Jung
Tsay in PNAS.

    People consistently report that sound is the most important source of
    information in evaluating performance in music. However, the findings
    demonstrate that people actually depend primarily on visual information
    when making judgments about music performance. People reliably select the
    actual winners of live music competitions based on silent video recordings,
    but neither musical novices nor professional musicians were able to
    identify the winners based on sound recordings or recordings with both
    video and sound.
