Seeing is Believing. But Don't Believe it.

One of the nice things about being at EMBL is that, if you just wait,
eventually you can hear the important people in your field speak. Today, I'm
quite excited about the `Seeing is Believing conference
<http://www.embo-embl-symposia.org/symposia/2013/EES13-03/>`__

But ever since I saw this advertised, I dislike the name *Seeing is Believing*.

1. Seeing is believing. This is unquestionable.
2. But *seeing is not always justified believing*. Our seeing apparatus will
   often lead us astray. This is especially true on 
3. The fact that seeing is believing is actually often a cognitive problem
   which needs to be overcome!

I can no longer find who said it a `BOSC
<http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2013>`__, but someone pointed out,
insightfully, that *a visualization is already an interpretation of the data,
it may be wrong*.

More often than not, I show you a picture of a cell, this is rarely raw data.
The raw data is a big pixel array. By the time I'm showing it to you I've done
the following:

1. Chosen an example to show.
2. Often projected the data from 3D to a 2D representation
3. Tweaked contrast.

Point 1 is the biggest culprit here: the selection of which cell to image and
show can be an incredibly biased process (even unconsciously biased, of
course).

However, even tweaks to the way that the projection is performed and to the
contrast can highlight or hide important details (as someone with a lot of
experience playing with images, I can tell you that there is a lot of space for
"highlighting what you want to show"). In the newer methods (super-resolution
type methods), this is even worse: the "picture" you see is already the output
of a big processing pipeline.

I'm not even thinking about the effects of the tagging protocols, which
introduces their own artifacts. But we, humans, often make the mistake of
saying things like "this is an image of protein A in cell type B" instead of
"this is an image of a chimeric protein which includes the sequence of A, with
a strong promoter in cell type B".

ยง

We know that these artifacts and biases are there, of course. But we believe
the images. And this can be a problem because humans are not actually all that
great at image analysis.

Seeing is believing, which too often means that we suspend our disbelief (or,
as we scientists, like to say: *we suspend our skepticism*).
