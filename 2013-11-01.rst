2. `Big Data Brain Drain
<http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/>`__. One of the
disandvantages of doing a Friday Links (instead of everyday or every-other-day
a post with *stuff I liked*) is that sometimes I think everyone has read what
I'm posting by the time it gets to Friday.

This post has been shared so many times, it reached me through several
different channels.
