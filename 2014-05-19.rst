1. `An evaluation of R² on nonlinear models
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892436/>`__

    Noted 25 years ago by Kvalseth [8], the user [of statistical software] is
    usually not able to identify which of the eight different definitions of R²
    that are commonly being used in the literature is chosen for the analysis
    output in statistical software.

    Part of the problem is that the Planck team has not made the raw foreground
    data available, he says. Instead, BICEP researchers had to do the best they
    could with a PDF file of that map that the Planck team presented at a
    conference.

I mean, seriously?

4. People say biology is the physics of the 21st century, but I've been
predicting that `physics will be the physics of the 21st century for a while

science or materials engineering has done amazing things in the lab which are
indistinguishable from magic and will soon be in products.
