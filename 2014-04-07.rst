How to win at 2048 or why 2048 is a stupid game

(This post contains a 2048 spoiler)

I too was caught up in craze about `2048

largest values on the bottom row, aligned left-to-right [#]_. Just make sure
you keep your highest tile on the corner and keep feeding the bottom row as

will always be able to put them together. The only dangerous moment is when you
score at the bottom as you risk destroying the organization if you're not
