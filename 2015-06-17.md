This is a place where everybody just eats awesome food all the time and enjoys
it, where many bars serve elaborate pintxos, which would be fancy cuisine

On the TV, there was an ad for a place that sells [molecular cuisine
equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Molecular_gastronomy).

Here they are cooking elaborate food all the time and so, when you are good
here, you are at the top of the world, which is how this small town has two
restaurants in the top 20 of [Restaurant
Magazine](http://www.theworlds50best.com/).
