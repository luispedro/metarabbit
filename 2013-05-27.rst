1. `The Tyranny of Formatting
<http://blog.neuinfo.org/index.php/news-events/the-tyranny-of-formatting>`__
The vision for 2014 is off by at least 10 years, but compelling.

It is even worse when you realise that most of the time we are still reviewing
these god-awful things in "manuscript format" where the reference are 10 pages
down and the figures are on separate pages &c. *We pay the cost of formatting
for submission and do not even get most of the benefits*.

By the way, kudos to `PeerJ on this matter <https://peerj.com/about/author-instructions/>`__:

    We include reference formatting as a guide to make it easier for editors,
    reviewers, and PrePrint readers, but will not strictly enforce the specific
    formatting rules as long as the full citation is clear.

    Styles will be normalized by us if your manuscript is accepted.

2. `Want women in science, pay postdocs more <http://incubator.rockefeller.edu/?p=1256>`__

This is a probably wrong, but interesting, argument.  (Also, as a male postdoc,
I'm all for the *pay postdocs more*.)

3. `Euphemisms for non-significant <http://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/>`__

Probably the authors did a few manipulations to try to get the P value below 5%
and failed. So, it is really non-significant.

4. Journalists have this expression that a story may be *too good to check*.
It's probably not true, but you just found such a good story that you don't
want to check before publishing.

Bioinformaticians should start talking about stories that are *too good to
debug*. The Mad Scientist posts about `exactly such stories <http://jasonya.com/wp/job-opening-worst-critic-better-fill-it-for-yourself-otherwise-someone-else-will/>`__
