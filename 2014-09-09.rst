Posting today from the lovely `KU Leuven campus
<http://www.chem.kuleuven.be/tccm2009/ArenbergCastle.jpg>`__ (yes, this is the
actual building where I'm sitting in now!).

1. From `Megan McArdle
   <http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-02/want-to-quit-smoking-or-lose-weight-try-major-surgery>`__
   on why very invasive surgery works better than less invasive surgery:

    Patients may prefer percutaneous coronary intervention -- also known as
    angioplasty -- to a coronary bypass because it doesn’t involve cracking
    your chest open and grafting things onto your heart. But bypass patients
    seem to have better long-term outcomes, even though both methods increase
    blood flow to the heart muscle. [...]

    A new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests
    a possible answer: Bypass works better precisely because it’s more
    invasive.  The very scale of the treatment makes people more likely to
    change their post-operative behavior in ways that enhance their long-term
    chances of survival

The `original paper <http://www.nber.org/papers/w20373>`__ states that

    We find that CABG patients are 12 percentage points more likely to quit
    smoking in the one-year period immediately surrounding their procedure than
    PCI patients, a result that is robust to numerous alternative
    specifications

2. I have in the past criticized nutricional sciences, but this is `excellent
   scientific behaviour
   <http://www.businessinsider.com.au/gluten-sensitivity-and-study-replication-2014-5>`__

    In one of the best examples of science working, a researcher who provided
    key evidence of (non-celiac disease) gluten sensitivity recently published
    follow-up papers that show the opposite.

    [...]

    For a follow-up paper, 37 self-identified gluten-sensitive patients were
    tested [...]

    The subjects cycled through high-gluten, low-gluten, and no-gluten
    (placebo) diets, without knowing which diet plan they were on at any given
    time. In the end, all of the treatment diets — even the placebo diet —
    caused pain, bloating, nausea, and gas to a similar degree. It didn’t
    matter if the diet contained gluten.

One of the most insidious things about some of the health fads is that because
of psychological effects, they do "work."
