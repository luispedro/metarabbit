1. On `doping &c
<http://ecologicallyoriented.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/anti-doping-research-politics-etc/>`__.
I like this protocol:

    More than one (usually two) questions are presented to each respondent, who
    picks which of the two to answer based on a simple probability mechanism
    that he/she controls, like the roll of a die. The interviewer does not know
    what the result of the roll was, and thus, which question the respondent
    answered.

    For example, if a 1, 2, or 3 comes up you answer question #1, which is
    innocuous and has a clear right answer, for example, *Does the ocean
    contain water?*. But if instead a 4 through 6 comes up, you then answer the
    sensitive question of interest, in this case whether you've used
    [Performance Enhancing Drugs] in the last 12 months. 

2. My Bioinformatics paper will make the `September 15 issue
<http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/18/2343.abstract>`__.

It has been available since early July in Advanced Access, now it is available
with a *September 15* date. Probably it matters for the people who still read
the paper version, but I never met anyone who still subscribed for the paper
edition.

3. `Dominant Assurance Contracts
<http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/08/a-test-of-dominant-assurance-contracts.html>`__

I love the logic behind this type of market design and to see that it works out
in practice is nice.
