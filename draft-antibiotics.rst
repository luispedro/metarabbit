The journalist (who is probably an intelligent young man) struggles with trying
to portrait antibiotics as either saviours or a curse. Are the standards of
public discourse so low that any concept beyond good/ungood is too complex?

It's not that complicated *antibiotic overuse is a problem because antibiotics
are awesome*. People taking antibiotics for the flu (which, because it is
viral, does not respond to antibiotics) risk creating bacterial infections
which are antibiotic resistant. However, before antibiotics people would die
from all sorts of things we now think of as harmless [#]_.

Also, *antibiotics do have other side-effects on the microbiota, therefore
don't take them when you don't have to*. This is like most medications, by the
way. Why is it complicated?

.. [#] The societal implications of antibiotics include safe child labour, safe
   abortions, and safe sex. Rolling these back would be a bit of a shame. Not
   to mention the explosion in child mortality that'd ensue.
