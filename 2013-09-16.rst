Let me illustrate what I was trying to say in a comment to João:

.. image:: 2013-09-16.png

If the top (red) image is your reference and green and blue are two candidate
solutions, then *pixel counting* (such as Rand and Jaccard) will say that green
is worse than blue. In fact, green differs by 558 pixels, while blue only by
511 pixels.

However, the green image is simply a fatter version of red (with a circa 2
pixel boundary) and boundaries cannot be really drawn at pixel level anyway.
The blue image, however, has an extra blob and so is qualitatively different.

The Hausdorff distance or my own *normalized sum of distances*, on the other
hand, would say that green is very much like red, while blue is more different.

(Thanks João for prompting this example. I used this when I gave a talk or two
about this paper, but it was lost in the paper because of page limits.)
