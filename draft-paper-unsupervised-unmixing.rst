Continuing down nostalgia lane, here is another old paper of mine:

    Coelho, Luis Pedro, Tao Peng, and Robert F. Murphy. “Quantifying the
    Distribution of Probes Between Subcellular Locations Using Unsupervised Pattern
    Unmixing.” Bioinformatics 26.12 (2010): i7–i12. `DOI:
    10.1093/bioinformatics/btq220
    <http://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq220>`__

I have already discussed the subcellular location determination problem. This
is *Given images of a protein, can we assign it to an organelle?*

This is, however, a simplified version of the world: many proteins are present
in multiple organelles. They may move between organelles in response to a
stimulus or as part of the cell cycle.

    I was pretty happy about these results, so were the other co-authors, we
    thought they were great, Nature Biotechnology agreed and mentioned it in
    positive terms... and nobody cited it for the longest time. Then, they did,
    and all was well.
