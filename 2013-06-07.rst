Some Links

1. A wonderful `explanation of Bergman divergences
<http://mark.reid.name/blog/meet-the-bregman-divergences.html>`__. I also
learned that cool result of Banerjee & Gou.

2. I liked `The Enduring Myth of the SPARQL Endpoint
<http://daverog.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/the-enduring-myth-of-the-sparql-endpoint/>`__.
This reminded of `Titus' remark` that *scaling is the only CS problem that
still matters*.

Money quote: *There is a reason there are no 'SQL Endpoints'.*
