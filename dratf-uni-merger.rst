The university where I got both my BS and MS from will soon cease to exist as a
separate entity. The University of Lisbon and the Technical University of
Lisbon are merging into one single institution.

The main reason is that there are too many institutional barriers to the
cross-disciplinary work that many people are doing across these institutions,
so it makes no sense to have two half-universities.

One interesting side effect, however, is that these institutions will shoot up
in many international rankings of research institutes. Many of them do not
correct for institute size, so if they measure *research output*, now it will
be much larger.

Nothing will have changed but the accounting. Still, a combined institution
will climb many steps in the ranking ladder.
