    In 1915, for example, Roche introduced a drug called Pantopon, which was
    also made from the opium poppy. It was said to be less addictive than
    morphine because it contained multiple compounds from the plant, which was
    supposed to be safer because it was more "natural." It wasn't.

    [...]

    In fact, the basis for the initial claim about OxyContin's reduced
    addiction potential wasn't actually wrong: The drug was a long-acting
    medication that was delivered slowly and steadily to the brain.

    Unfortunately, recreational users almost immediately figured out how to
    defeat its time-release mechanism by crushing the pills, which then
    delivered a quick, massive dose when snorted, eaten, or injected.

    [..]

    The current version of OxyContin [..] contains substances that turn it into
    a gel if people try to dissolve it, which makes the drug almost impossible
    to get into a syringe.  The tablets are also far more difficult to grind up
    small enough to defeat the time-release mechanism by snorting or swallowing
    a crushed pill.

(It is opportune to point out that persisten pain is a major health problem and
we should be careful about taking needed medication away from people who
suffer. Radley Balko has a `good series on this
