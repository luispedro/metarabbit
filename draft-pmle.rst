Luis Pedro: Thank you. In the background, there are two distinct audiences: The first are programmers who do not know much of machine learning, but liked to use a classifier, for example. The second are people who do not need an introduction to machine learning (because they already know), but maybe do not know how to do it with the tools in Python.

There are many books on the market that touch these issues. What destacas in your book as a differentiating factor compared to other books that exist?

The main use is the Python libraries.

How was writing a book together? Each co-author wrote a piece? As was the case in practice?

Luis Pedro: First there was a discussion to three: the two of us and the publishers. This lasted for several weeks by email. Once defined the structure of the book, we divided the chapters.

In some cases it was natural: I have a chapter of computer vision because it is my research and talked to my library (Mahotas). The Willi knows a lot of data processing audio and treated in this chapter (for example, I would have gone there to read literature). In other cases, it was something random: both I and he could have introduced the linear regression and the like (Ridge, lassos, ...).

We used the github to work and both saw what the other was doing.

As time elapsed from the moment proposed to start the project up to the time the book appears in bookstores?

Luis Pedro: One of the good things of this project, for me, was how quickly it all happened. I started writing in October. This time is not yet in bookstores, but you can already buy a version online. I think it will finally be completely available in September. I have two papers submitted to scientific journals more or less at the same time I started writing the book, and this time, these papers are not published. The scientific world goes to a slower pace.

What were the main difficulties encountered in this process?

Luis Pedro: The challenge is always to find examples that are not just a joke, but they are not also too difficult for an introduction. In one case (image classification), it was I who took some photographs to create a dataset. In the literature, there or classical examples are trivial to modern techniques and current research problems that are very difficult. My dataset is poorly framed photographs taken with a mobile phone camera. Therefore, it also has a style more akin to a problem area or mobile web. The aim is to rank among photographs of buildings (urban) landscape, or texts.

There was nothing too complex for anyone who knows the area. In fact, when it comes to writing about something you already know how to do (as was the case), the hard part is the motivation.


Even in the world of research papers still find that mix training set and test set! Obviously not coming into work groups of machine learning, but in more applied areas is still those who test hyper-parameters in the test set.
