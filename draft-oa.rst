A while back, I quipped on twitter:

This is a longer post on the silly arguments that Open Access advocates make.

"Even Harvard cannot afford journal subscriptions"

I mean, seriously? Look at this comment on Jeffrey Beall's blog:


Jeffrey Beall replied that Duke had just spent 38 million in rebuilding its
library, surely some of that could have gone to buying licenses.

But more basically: *if they cannot afford 4000 for a Nature X subscription,
how will they afford open access?* That is less than 3 publications in Plos
One, not even 2 in Plos Biology.

It is not really clear that open access will be cheaper for Harvard (or Duke),
actually. If anybody will be saving money with open access, it will probably be
the smaller universities in poorer countries. Now, this is fine: let Harvard
pay for publication costs so that researchers in South America or Southern
Europe can read it. But, it is the opposite of the typical "not even Harvard
can pay for it."

"Open Access reduces costs"

I actually think this might be true, but it is normally argued wrongly
confusing margins and profits, implying that all open access publishing will be
done by scruffy non-profits, or some absurdity like this.

I just see one important sources of cost reduction: the lack of a sales force
negociating with libraries. There is less negociation, which is generally a
good thing. On the other hand, there is much less price pressure to keep
publishing fees down. Hidawi has huge margins. Plos does not have very large
declared profits, because it is using the money to serve other causes.

Publishing is probably getting cheaper as it becomes digital, but this is true
for both closed and open access.

"Elsevier is evil because they supported some piece of legislation"

Perhaps so, but what does this have to do with open access?

Elsevier does open access too, by the way.

"The general public has the right to read the science they paid for"

And since they paid for the roads, gasoline needs to be subsidized.

"Funders shy away from mandating open access because they are in the pocket of
Big Paper"
