Protip: Enable deprecation warnings in Python

Since version 2.7, Python no longer outputs anything when a deprecation warning
is hit. This is a good idea if you are running apps that use Python internally
as you might not care about this sort of thing. However, **it's a bad idea if
you are developing Python yourself**.

You can turn them back on by either (1) passing ``-Wd`` on the command line, or
(2) setting the ``PYTHONWARNINGS`` environmental variable to ``d``. In fact,
this allows you to just set this option in your ``.bashrc`` (or ``.zshrc``)::

    export PYTHONWARNINGS=d

Now, all your Python will warn you about deprecations, which you should care
about as a developer.
