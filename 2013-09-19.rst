Mahotas-imread Now Accepts Options When Writing

This week, I committed to `mahotas-imread
<https://github.com/luispedro/imread>`__, some code to allow for setting
options when saving::

    from imread import imsave

    image = ...
    imsave('file.jpeg', image, opts={ 'jpeg:quality': 95 })

This saves the ``image`` array to file ``file.jpeg`` with quality 95.

This is only available in the version from `github
<https://github.com/luispedro/imread>`__ (at the moment), but I will probably
put up a new release soon.
