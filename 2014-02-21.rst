1. `Mathematical proof by computer
<http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25068-wikipediasize-maths-proof-too-big-for-humans-to-check.html>`__

I don't fully understand why you'd want to verify the output of the programme
and not just the code/reasoning behind it.

2. `A computer mines the literature for mistakes
<http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/02/19/robocombing_the_chemistry_literature_for_mistakes.php>`__

This seems great: a computational system that checks the scientific literature.

3. From the Oxford University Press, ladies and gentlemen, we have this insight
into modern physics:

    I am struck by the fact that treatises on particle physics never say what
    shape the particles have, and whether different kinds of particles might
    have different shapes.  In diagrams they are usually depicted as spherical,
    but such a determination never plays a role in the theories of particles —
    unlike questions of charge and mass. Would it matter if an electron had a
    star shape?

    — `Basic Structures of Reality
    <http://global.oup.com/academic/product/basic-structures-of-reality-9780199841103>`__
    by Colin McGinn

Sokal would be proud to publish there. Do read the full `review in Mind
<http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/10/31/mind.fzt073.full.pdf>`__
[#]_, which summarises the book thus:

    McGinn’s thesis, to repeat, is that our technical competence with physics
    ‘conceals vast chasms of ignorance’.

On the other hand, McGinn's technical incompetence conceals nothing.

.. [#] Before you lump all the *ignorant philosophers* into one bag, note that
   this review is from a philosophy journal.
