I decided to blog all my old papers (from when I did not have a science blog).

    NUCLEAR SEGMENTATION IN MICROSCOPE CELL IMAGES: A HAND-SEGMENTED DATASET

It's more of a solid paper than a break-through one, so it is interesting that
this is currently my most cited paper (according to `Google Scholar
<http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qTYua0cAAAAJ&hl=en>`__).

The original question of this paper was very simple: *is it worth it to code up
and run a complex segmentation algorithm over a simple one on that we were
working with?*

I hand-segmented a bunch of images from our datasets. Frankly, if I knew how
much work this would take; I'd not have done it.  And I would not have written
this paper. I believe that this is why it is widely cited: a lot of people
understand the value of the dataset (and use it for their work).

Here is the `reproducible research archive for this paper
