Merging directories without loss of files

A problem I often have is to have two directories which are probably mostly the
same, but maybe not completely as some of the files might be newer (edited)
versions of the other.

For example, directory ``A``::

    A/
    A/document.txt
    A/blogpost.txt
    A/photo.jpg
    A/me.jpg

and ``B``::

    B/
    B/document.txt
    B/photo.jpg
    B/me.jpg
    B/you.jpg

Now, I want to merge ``A`` and ``B``. With only this small number of files, I
could easily check by hand if ``document.txt`` is the same on both sides, &c.
However, in a large directory, this becomes impossible, so I wrote up a `small
utitlity <https://github.com/luispedro/merge>`__ to do so::

    mergedirs B A

Will go through all of the files in ``B`` and check whether an equivalent file
in ``A`` exists. If so, *it will check the contents** (and flags, depending on
the command line arguments used) and **refuse to remove any file for which you
do not have a copy**.

Another cute thing it can do is compute a hash of a directory with all its
files::

    mergedirs --mode=hash

Prints out (for a directory called ``merge``)::

    merge                    4a44a8706698da50f41fef5fdcffd163

This can be useful to check whether two directories in different computers are
exactly the same (in terms of file contents, flags &c).

It's mostly a tool I wrote to `scratch my own itch
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar>`__. I have no plans
to develop it beyond my needs, but I it might be useful for others
too.
