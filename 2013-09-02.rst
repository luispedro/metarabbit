Non-Computational Thinking

There is a lot of talk about *Computational Thinking*, typically followed by
the observation that we don't know what it is or cannot define it.

Which I think it is true, but it is perhaps easier if we try to watch out for
**non-computational thinking** instead.

§

Recently, the MLA `defined how to cite a tweet
<http://www.mla.org/style/handbook_faq/cite_a_tweet>`__ in their (widely used)
style:

    Begin the entry in the works-cited list with the author’s real name and, in
    parentheses, user name, if both are known and they differ. If only the user
    name is known, give it alone.

    Next provide the entire text of the tweet in quotation marks, without changing
    the capitalization. Conclude the entry with the date and time of the message
    and the medium of publication (Tweet). For example:

    Athar, Sohaib (ReallyVirtual). "Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM
    (is a rare event)." 1 May 2011, 3:58 p.m. Tweet.

§

I think this is an example of non-computational thinking: tweets have unique
numeric IDs, so that you can link to them but they are not mentioned. They do
discuss that the time stamp is time-zone dependent.

(Although, truth be told, twitter does not make it easy to get at the tweet
ID).
