During the break, another paper where I played a part came out:

    *Host-cell sensors for Plasmodium activate innate immunity against
    liver-stage infection* by Liehl et al., in Nature Medicine (2013) `[DOI]
    <http://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3424>`__

`Plasmodium <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium>`__, the malaria causing
parasite, when entering the human body, first infects the liver. There, the
small number of initial parasites (perhaps only a handful of them), multiply
until they burst into the blood stream where they cause havoc, which can have
potentially fatal consequences if left untreated.

The liver stage is clinically silent, with no visible symptoms. However, it
does not go completely undetected by the host's immune system. There were
previous reports of an immune response in the liver, but we worked on
understanding more of what was going on and observed a type-I interferon
response using transcriptomics.

What I thought was most surprising (although this may be a function of my
naïveté) was that the response seems to be activated by *RNA sensing*. The host
detects the Plasmodium RNA and **that triggers an immune response**. This is
some bad ass immune system stuff: using RNA sensors against eukariotic
parasites instead of just viruses.

Nature Medicine thought this was cool too and `wrote up summary
<http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v20/n1/full/nm.3446.html>`__ as well as
putting the paper on the cover of January edition!
