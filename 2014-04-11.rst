3. It's `world homeopathy awareness week <http://www.worldhomeopathy.org/>`__!
I'll quote `@mocost <https://twitter.com/mocost/status/454197874898006016>`__
on twitter:

    It's World Homeopathy Awareness Week, apparently. Are you aware that
    homeopathy is pseudoscientific bullshit?

4. `Angst in Germany over English invasion

I liked this bit about the *lounge* at train stations:

    "I'm not sure if calling it a 'lounge' is better than using the German word
    'warteraum,' " Renner says. "I guess it's more modern or hip."

Warteraum just means *waiting area* (both literally and not-so-literately).

Recently, I got enough points to get "frequent travel status" on German trains.
One of the perks is free access to the lounge area. Somehow, that perk would
not feel like such a perk if they had written *free access to the waiting
area*.
