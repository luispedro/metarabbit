Mahotas Software Meta Paper Published
--

I got a new paper published:

    Mahotas: open source software for scriptable computer vision
    by Luis Pedro Coelho in Journal of Open Research Software

This is about my computer vision software package, `mahotas
<http://github.com/luispedro/mahotas>`__. It started as a way to do `bioimage
informatics <>`__, but the sotware is more general than that

The journal calls these *metapapers* in that they are not the work but a
reference to the work, i.e., the software. This is an interesting new
iniciative to reward scientific software development. As I argued before,
`release of scientific software is a collective action problem
<https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/people-are-right-not-to-share-scientific-code/>`__:
It is better for science to have software released, but not for the individual
researcher. I also wrote that it would be a good idea to change the incentives
to make it more profitable to do the right thing. The Journal of Open Research
Software is exactly one such step.
