Due to popular demand (at least two people asked, surely that's demand), here
is a generalization of `Monday's work
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/how-long-does-plos-one-take-to-accept-a-paper/>`__
to include a few more PLoS journals.  (This was mostly because it was easier to
generalize my scripts to process process any PLoS journal.)

Here are the images for all PLoS journals. PLoS 1 at the end is the same figure
I posted on Monday.

**For PLoS journals, it seems that the average acceptance time is 5 months.**

PLoS Medicine is the journal that takes the longest to review, PLoS One is the
fastest (although some of the papers may have been reviewed in another PLoS
journal before, speeding up the process).
