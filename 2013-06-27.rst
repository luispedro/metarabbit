Yesterday, I argued that `computer programming should be part of basic
instruction
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/computer-programming-as-liberal-arts/>`__.

Today, I'll talk about a particular group of people who **need** to learn to
programme: scientists, even lab scientists.

Personally, one of the great draws of moving away from academia into industry
(the good industry places, at least) is to be able to use decent tools. **Code
sharing is a solved problem** (the solution is `version control
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>`__). CVS was released in 1986.
That's almost 30 years ago. In academia, use of this type of tool is not (yet?)
widespread.

In this context, I have (for a long time now) been putting my effort where my
mouth is and created a course called `Programming for Scientists
<http://luispedro.org/projects/pfs>`__, which I have taught a couple of times.

Last week, at EMBL, I helped teach a course on Python. This was done on a tight
schedule and still we were overwhelmed with demand (we sold out in about 24
after a single email announcement).

`Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ is another great
project to teach scientists about programming and computer usage.
