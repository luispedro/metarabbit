also recently popular:

`crystals of water reflect emotions

What are people thinking when they believe this? I mean, how do they think
water works?

(How do they think reality works?)

4. `Forward and reverse modeling
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/12/29/abstract>`__

I think there should have been more discussion of "approximation" in there (the
author claims that physics-based models are infalliable or would point at
fundamental new discoveries in physics; but physics-based models with
approximate computations need not be infalliable)
