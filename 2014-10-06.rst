John Cook tells this `wonderful story about Windows 10
<http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/10/02/the-mistakes-of-others/>`__:

    The version of Windows following 8.1 will be Windows 10, not Windows 9.
    Apparently this is because Microsoft knows that a lot of software naively
    looks at the first digit of the version number, concluding that it must be
    Windows 95 or Windows 98 if it starts with 9.
    
    Many think this is stupid. They say that Microsoft should call the next
    version Windows 9, and if somebody’s dumb code breaks, it’s their own
    fault.
    
    People who think that way aren’t billionaires.

Open source has generally been horrible about this, with the major exception of
the Linux kernel, because Linus' attitude is `very different

    It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a
    maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel
    maintenance?

    If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the
    kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to
    understand?

Note the very different attitude of the `glibc developers
<http://lwn.net/Articles/414467/>`__, who *broke Flash Player for their users
and said it was all Adobe's fault*.
